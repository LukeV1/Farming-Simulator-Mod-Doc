***Helping Out***

**Setting up on your computer**
If you plan to do anything that involves working with the backend that handles generating the documents, make sure that
you have the python packages specified in `requirements.txt` installed.


*Pull Requests*
* Use the template that best fits the scope of your PR.
* Make sure to mention what you changed.
* Provide an example of a working game file or mod that uses the change your have proposed.
* Try to make sure that only one main change is made per Pull Request. If you cannot, that is ok. We can work with it.

*If you don't understand how the documentation is set up, or how to use github*
* File a issue.
* Detail exactly what you would add.
* Provide an example as proof.
* These might take a while to get added, as someone will have to find time to make the changes suggested.

**Making a bug report or a suggestion**
* Both are filed in the issues tab.
* Use the template that best fits your case.
